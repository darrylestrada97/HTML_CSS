# OMNIFOOD PROJECT 

This is a project that I have created to practice my HTML and CSS skills. It is a fictional food delivery service called
Omnifood. The project is a single page website that includes a header, features, how it works, cities, customer 
testimonials, sign up, and contact sections. The website is fully responsive and works on all devices.
